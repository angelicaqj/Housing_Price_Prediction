# Housing_Price_Prediction

## Description

This project is a Kaggle competition to predict housing sale, https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques. 
The idea with this project is to pre(processing) categorical and numerical features through naive and smart binarization, and after that to build the regression model(s) to make accurate predictions with a semiblind test file that does not contain the sale price.

## Instructions

1. Download the csv files (my_train, my_dev, test)
2. Open jupyter notebook in the terminal of your computer. 
3. Run house_price_prediction.ipynb in the same directory where you download the files to test and analyze the project.
